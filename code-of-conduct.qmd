title: "Code of Conduct"
---

Students participating in our Summer Undergraduate Research Experience
here at [[Carnegie
Mellon]{.underline}](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/code/index.html#:~:text=These%20standards%20require%20personal%20integrity,must%20be%20met%2C%20commitments%20kept)
are to consider themselves part of the Carnegie Mellon academic
community and are expected to meet and maintain the highest personal and
professional ethics and conduct.

We are committed to cultivating a transformative and educational
experience, as well as safeguarding personal health and well-being. We
require students to act with personal and intellectual integrity, to
speak honestly, and to treat themselves and others with the utmost
respect.

Students participating in the program are expected to:

-   Respect the rights of your instructors, assistants and other staff,
    as well as your peers

-   Promote the health and safety of all members of our diverse
    community

-   Treat others with honesty and fairness

-   Respect the property of others as well as that of Carnegie Mellon

-   Understand and abide by all [[Carnegie Mellon community
    standards]{.underline}](https://www.cmu.edu/student-affairs/theword/index.html#community)
    as well as all local, state, and federal laws

The Statistics & Data Science department and Carnegie Mellon prohibits
conduct that creates a hostile environment for faculty, staff, students,
or other parties. Examples include:

-   Disrespect toward an instructor, peer, or other members of the
    Statistics & Data Science community

-   Abusive, intimidating, hostile or obscene language, gestures, or
    behavior

-   Any kind of [[discrimination or
    harassment]{.underline}](https://www.cmu.edu/policies/forms-and-documents/soa-violations.pdf)
    that would create a hostile or abusive environment for any member
    of our community

-   Any kind of unwelcome coercive, exploitive, or other forms of
    [[prohibited sexual
    misconduct]{.underline}](https://www.cmu.edu/policies/administrative-and-governance/sexual-misconduct/policy-statement.html)

When all members of the community uphold these values, we are able to
provide a formative and collaborative experience for all summer program
participants.
