Welcome to the Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) 2023 hosted by
the Department of Statistics & Data Science at Carnegie Mellon University. We
are excited to guide you through exciting topics in statistics and data science,
focusing on applications in sports and health analytics.

To get you started, please complete our step-by-step instructions for setting up
the common tools that you will use throughout the program.

# `R` and `RStudio`

`R` is an open-source programming language for statistical computing. `R` is
widely-used in both academia and industry, due to its capacity for statistical
analysis, data visualization, and data mining. **We will use `R` as our primary
data science programming language for SURE 2023.**

In order to use `R` effectively, we need a suitable editing environment, i.e.
`RStudio`. For more context, `RStudio` is an integrated development environment
(IDE) developed specifically for `R` programming. Although `R` can be run
without `RStudio`, `RStudio` provides a more user-friendly experience with
additional functionality.

::: {.callout-warning}
You are more than welcome to use any other IDE that supports `R`, e.g., `emacs`,
`VIM`, `neovim`, `VSCode`, etc.

However, the teaching staff will only provide support for the latest `RStudio`
IDE.
:::

To download `R` and `RStudio`, first visit
<https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop>.

You will see the following two tasks to be completed: 

- **1: Install `R`** (on the left)
- **2: Install `RStudio`** (on the right)

## Step 1: Install `R`

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}

## Install `R`

(*Note that the following instructions apply to the latest `R` version (4.3.0)
as of May 31, 2023*)

Click on ***DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL R***. This will direct you to the CRAN
(Comprehensive R Archive Network) website.

**macOS**

  - Click on ***Download R for macOS***.

  - Choose the `.pkg` file suitable for your Mac (*Apple silicon (M1/M2) Macs*
    or *older Intel Macs*.)

  - Open the `.pkg` file after the download is complete.

  - Follow the installation instructions.
  
**Windows**

  - Click on ***Download R for Windows***.

  - Click on ***install R for the first time*** (on the same line as the
    ***base*** subdirectory.)

  - Choose ***Download R 4.3.0 for Windows***.

  - Open the `.exe` file after the download is complete.

  - Follow the installation instructions.
:::

## Step 2: Install `RStudio`

::: {.callout-important}
## Important
`R` **must** be installed before `RStudio`.
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}

## Install `RStudio`

Click on ***DOWNLOAD RSTUDIO DESKTOP...*** Your operating system is
automatically detected. (If your OS is not correctly detected, scroll down and
choose the right version for your system.)

**macOS** 

  - Open the `.dmg` file after the download is complete.

  - Drag and drop it to your Applications folder.
  
**Windows** 

  - Open the `.exe` file after the download is complete.

  - Follow the installation instructions.

Open `RStudio` once the installation is finished. You should get something
similar to the image below. We will run a few commands later in the **Console
pane**, which is located on the bottom left corner and highlighted in red.

:::

## Step 3: Check `R` and `RStudio` installations {#step3}

Next, we run a quick check to verify that everything looks right after
installations, 


::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}

## Post-installation check

Open `RStudio` and type in the following command in the Console pane on the
bottom left.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
version
```

This will print out the current version of `R` on your machine. The output
should look similar to what shown below (the first 4 lines might be different,
depending on your operating system.)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
version
```

The following gif shows what it looks like in action.

![](files/images/version.gif){height=300}

</center>

:::

## Step 4: Install required packages

We suggest that you install the following minimal set of `R` packages which are
needed to get started with SURE 2023. We will recommend more packages for you to
install as we progress through the program.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}

## Package installation

In `R`, a package is a collection of functions, data and compiled code. In
addition to a set of built-in base packages, there are numerous external `R`
packages written by the community to add specific functionality.

To get started with SURE 2023, you will need to install a minimal set of
packages. Again, open `RStudio` and type in the following command in the Console
pane on the bottom left (refer to the gif in [Step 3](#step3) for how to access
the `RStudio` Console pane).

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rec_packages <- c("tidyverse", "styler", "xaringan", "xaringanthemer", 
                  "xaringanExtra", "tidymodels")
install.packages(rec_packages)
```

We can verify successful package installation, e.g., for the `tidyverse`, which
is arguably the most popular `R` package for data science. To do this, run the
following command in the `RStudio` Console pane.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

You should get a message similar to the output below.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Step 5: Setup and run `R` Primers on Posit Cloud

In addition to following the steps above for installing `R` and RStudio on your
computer, **we recommend you make a free Posit Cloud account at
<https://posit.cloud/>.** This is a free, browser-based version of `R` and
RStudio that also provides access to a growing number of `R` tutorials / primersrelevant to the summer program material 

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
### Setup Posit Cloud

After you create a free Posit Cloud account, click on the navigation menu by "Your
Workspace". Then click on ["Primers"](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers) to
bring up a menu of tutorials. **Prior to June 6th, please complete the following
(listed in order of importance)**:

  - in ["The Basics"](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/1), you only need to
    complete the ["Programming Basics"](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/1.2)
    primer,
  - complete all three primers in ["Work with
    Data"](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/2),
  - complete all seven primers in ["Write
    Functions"](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/6).

Feel free to explore the other primers listed, specifically for
["Iterate"](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/5) and ["Tidy Your
Data"](https://posit.cloud/learn/primers/4). We will be covering data
visualization extensively in the first two weeks, so you do not worry about
working through the data visualization primers.

After completing the above primers available on the RStudio Cloud, **try
replicating the some type of `R` programming basics in your own local version of
`R` and RStudio installed on your computer**. RStudio Cloud is a great practical
alternative to use **in case we are unable to resolve errors with regards to
installation on your own personal computer** (an unlikely scenario). We strongly
encourage you to use an installed version of `R` and RStudio throughout the
program, due to RStudio Cloud data limitations that are important for your
research projects throughout the summer.

:::

**Do not worry if you are unable to complete all of the `R` tutorials and steps
above prior to June 5th.** The teaching assistants will be reviewing the `R` and
`tidyverse` basics and materials in the first week's lab sessions. Again, if you
have any questions, do not hesitate to reach out to the instructors above and we
look forward to meeting you June 5th!

The [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) is a great reference
for good coding style. It is supported by the
[`styler`](https://styler.r-lib.org/) package in `R`. The figure above provides
a simple demonstration for code formatting with `styler`, taken from the package
site.

## David Robinson's TidyTuesday screencasts

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/static/tt_logo.png){height=150}](https://www.youtube.com/@safe4democracy/streams)

Each video is a detailed walk-through on how to approach, clean, summarize,
visualize, and analyze a dataset provided by the
[TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project. Useful
`R` tips and tricks are often offered. For context, TidyTuesday releases a
weekly dataset, aiming to promote data analysis with the `tidyverse` suite of
packages. Numerous examples of TidyTuesday contributions (e.g., visualizations)
can be found under the [\#TidyTuesday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/TidyTuesday)
Twitter hashtag.
