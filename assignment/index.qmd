title: "Assignments"
---

There are two main forms of assignments in the SURE 2023 program, namely:

  - Demo-labs
  - Final research project, poster and presentation

Some additional details on both are provided below. You can view all assignment
materials by navigating the links in the left sidebar, or via the [course
schedule](../schedule.qmd).

## Demo-labs

We also provide you demo-lab materials for you to test out your understanding of
the course content. Completing these demo-labs is strongly recommended to
reinforce the material. There is no grading involved here, just learning.

## Research project deliverables

As noted in our [syllabus](../syllabus.qmd) and [schedule](../schedule.qmd) the
**only deliverables** you have are your final (Optum or CMSAC) research project
report, poster, and presentation. Although the research project won't be
formally graded, all of these deliverables will be presented by you to various
important stakeholders in healthcare (Optum) and sports (CMSAC) data science
community. So it is in your best interest to put your best foot forward!
