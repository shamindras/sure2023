## Biography

Shamindra received my PhD from in the Department of Statistics & Data Science at
Carnegie Mellon University in Fall 2022. He was extremely fortunate to be
advised by Matey Neykov. Shamindra's primary research interests focus density
estimation, isotonic regression, and location-scale estimation. He is also
actively interested in application-driven methodology, including spatiotemporal
modeling (wildfire prediction), and also statistical ranking. In the latter
case, he was fortunate to present at the CMSACamp in 2019.

Prior to his PhD, he worked for eight years in industry first as a private and
public sector actuary, before branching out into broader data science and data
engineering in the online and supermarket retail sectors. He also holds a MA in
Statistics from UC Berkeley, and BCom majoring in Actuarial Studies and Finance
from the University of New South Wales.

He grew up in Australia, so feel free to talk to him about cricket, rugby union, 
etc. But importantly reach out to him with any queries during SURE 2023!
