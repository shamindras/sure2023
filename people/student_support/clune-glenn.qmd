## Biography

Glenn Clune is part of the undergraduate advising team for our Statistics & Data
Science students. Starting with the department in the summer of 2018, he has
continually strived to help students feel welcome and supported during their
time with the department, and has maintained a particular commitment to
supporting first generation, underrepresented and underprivileged students
navigate through the challenges of higher education.
