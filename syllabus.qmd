<!-- # Welcome to SURE 2023 -->

Welcome to the Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE) 2023. The purpose
of this program is to explore cutting-edge statistics and data science
methodology with applications in healthcare and sports analytics.

SURE 2023 is only made possible through the generous and ongoing support by our
program partners in healthcare
([Optum](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/summerbridge/)), and sports data science

:::

-   [Lectures](/classes/index.qmd) and [lab materials](/assignment/index.qmd) will be openly accessible via links in our [schedule](schedule.qmd).

-   Additional (free!) supplementary resources can be found [here](/guides/computing-setup.qmd#sec-computing-setup-resources).  

# Program Objectives

As a Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE), the purpose of
this program is to give participating students research experience in
applied statistics and data science. In particular the focus is on two
broad domains, health (Optum) and sports analytics (CMSAC). Upon the
SURE 2023 program completion, we hope that you come out with:

-   **A foundational toolkit of data science and machine learning
    methods**

    -   You'll gain experience *learning how to learn* new techniques in
        this area-- we cannot possibly cover everything to know as a
        data scientist, especially as the field is constantly
        evolving, but you should know where to turn for new methods
        and how to use the vast resources that are available to you.

-   **An understanding of how and when to apply those methods**

    -   Beyond just hearing about techniques like clustering,
        generalized linear models, and random forests, you'll get
        hands-on experience using them for yourselves in a several
        weeks-long project directly dealing with a question of
        interest in health or sports analytics

-   **Hands-on experience working with real data, in a research or
    industry setting**

    -   Data science research is tough but rewarding. There will be
        setbacks, and you will be frustrated at times. But there will
        also be breakthroughs, and you'll be proud of your progress
        along the way as well as the end result itself.

While this program will involve lectures on data science and data
engineering, this is not a summer course in the traditional sense. It is
intended to be highly interactive and invigorating. We hope you are as
excited about this experience as we are, and if you are willing to put
in your time, effort, and enthusiasm, we know that you will have a
rewarding summer.

# Deliverables

For all SURE students there are **three main deliverables** for the
program. They relate to a **single research project**, which you will
complete as part of a student group. The three related research
deliverables are:

1.  Project **report**
2.  Project **poster**
3.  Project **presentation**

Optum students will do their research projects based on
healthcare-focused data science topics, while CMSAC will do their
research projects in the sports analytics domain. Details on the
specification guidance on your research project topic will be provided
once we commence the program.

As stated before, this is not a traditional summer course. There are no
grades, no weekly assignments (yay!), other than those related to the
above deliverables. Weekly milestones will be provided, with standards
and rubrics, to guide you along the way. We expect you to take an active
role in your learning here: ask questions during lectures, demo labs,
and office hours. Seek regular feedback from the instructors and TA
advisors in project labs. You'll get out of this program what you put
into it.

If the deliverables for the project seem daunting, just remember that
the staff for this program want you to succeed and we are here to
support you along the way. Also, actively building these research skills
is important for you to practice! And it's fantastic for your CV!

# Program Components

In order to help you meet your [[program
deliverables]{.underline}](#deliverables), there are four main
components of the summer program:

1.  Lectures
2.  Domain-specific presentations
3.  Demo labs
4.  Project labs

We now describe each of the four components in turn below.

## Lectures

**Lectures** will be delivered to both Optum and CMSAC students together. Each
morning, we will cover topics in data science, including: data wrangling,
exploratory data analysis, and both supervised/unsupervised learning.
Separately, Tuesday afternoons will feature lectures on data engineering,
including: the `UNIX`, `SQL`, `tmux`, etc..

## Domain-specific presentations

Around mid-day, most days of the summer, you will also have
**presentations from industry professionals** in your domain area. On
the Optum side, there is a full slate of **mandatory** **virtual talks**
from members of the United Health Group (UHG) to familiarize you with
the work they do and give career advice. These are a fantastic
networking opportunity for Optum students for future career
opportunities. For the sports side, the first few weeks will involve
sports analysts coming in to pitch projects in baseball, hockey,
basketball, and soccer. You'll have the chance to then choose one of
these projects to work on for the rest of the summer. There will also be
various visitors later on to speak about working in sports analytics.

## Demo labs

Then, on Monday afternoons (and some Wednesdays at the beginning of the
program), you'll be able to get hands-on practice applying methods in
data science with **demo labs** run by the program TAs. These labs will
be conducted separately for the two groups. All materials (Optum and
CMSAC) will be made available on this course website, if you want extra
practice from both health and sports domains.

## Project labs

Finally, the most important component of the program is the **research
project**, and associated deliverables. In **dedicated project-lab sessions**,
you'll work in a group of 2-4 students to analyze a dataset in health or sports
analytics to answer a research question that is important to practitioners in
your field. Past projects have examined geographic differences in the impact of
the opioid epidemic, built models to predict passing or running plays in the
NFL, and performed cluster analysis of NBA and WNBA players. At the end of the
program, you'll hand in a report summarizing your findings, create a poster, and
deliver a short presentation to the community and project stakeholders.

# Attendance and participation

**Attendance in-person is required** at all program events. You are
expected to be fully present for all lectures, presentations, and labs,
meaning we expect your focus to be on the material being offered. Please
do not listen to music, watch videos, check Instagram/TikTok/etc. during
these activities. Our team has put forth a lot of effort (blood, sweat,
and yes some tears...) into ensuring that this program gives you a rich
and **interactive research experience**. Engaging in such distracting
activities is ultimately disrespectful to that organizational effort, as
well as to your peers who came here to learn. We hope that such
activities and related incidents are avoided, and that we all have a
great summer working and learning together. Keep in mind that when you
take part in SURE 2023, you must always abide by the [code of
conduct](code-of-conduct.qmd).

Active participation is also extremely important to this program. **If
you have any questions, clarifications, or curiosities during lectures,
please ask!** More importantly, the labs are your time to really dig in
and work with data and methods, so we expect you to participate fully in
these immersive sessions. For the projects, you have a duty to your
group and to your advisors to give it your full effort. If program staff
notice that individuals are not adhering to these expectations, we will
intervene.

### Take rest, and stay at home if you're sick

Please note that taking good rest is a critical part of doing effective
research. If you are feeling unwell during the program, please stay at home and
take rest. However, in such cases it is vital that you notify Glenn Clune
(SURE 2023 academic advisor) in a timely manner. This way we can ensure that you
get the support you need, when you need it the most.
:::

# Resources and Communication

We will use the following four primary communication channels throughout
the SURE 2023 program:

1.  Course Website
2.  Google Calendar
3.  Slack
4.  Email

For inquiries regarding scheduling, resources, etc., you should first
check the program website and calendar, then reach out to other
students, and lastly ask TAs or instructors. Following this order of
operations will ensure your needs are swiftly addressed and not
bottlenecked by a single person's availability. It is important to note
that all communication throughout SURE 2023 (including the above
channels) **[must]{.underline}** abide by the [code of conduct.](code-of-conduct.qmd)

We now describe each of the four channels and how to use them most effectively, in turn below.

## Course Website

This SURE 2023 website will be the main "home base" for the entirety of
the program. You are expected to check it regularly throughout each day
in the program for any updates. All lecture and demo-lab materials will
be provided on the site, freely available. As stated before, there is no
textbook for this program, just lecture slides that you'll be able to
access via the [schedule](schedule.qmd). There you will also find specifications for the projects and lab files.

For non-academic concerns, we have compiled a list of helpful guides, e.g., [computing setup](/guides/computing-setup.qmd), [Pittsburgh-based resources](/guides/pittsburgh-student-resources.qmd), [fun local activities](/guides/pittsburgh-fun-activities.qmd). We also have dedicated [staff bios](people.qmd) to help you quickly find the right person for
any questions that might arise. Keep browsing around, we'll keep adding to
it over the program to make it your 'one-stop-shop' for all your major concerns.

## Schedule

In addition to the website, we will be using an **online calendar**, which you
can and should add to your personal scheduling software of choice (Google, iCal,
Outlook, etc.), and which you will be expected to keep track of. You will
receive a link to this calendar via email. It will be the most up-to-date source
of information about when and where things will be happening in the program.

A glimpse of a 'typical' week, via the Google Calendar, is as follows:

> ![](./files/syllabus-daily-sure-schedule.png){width="6.5in" height="2.9722222222222223in"}

As mentioned, data-science lectures for all SURE 2023 students will take place
in the morning. Then there will be separate presentations for the Optum and
CMSAC groups around lunchtime, and in the afternoon we will have demo-labs,
data-engineering, and project labs. As mentioned, you are expected to attend
program activities **in-person** during the **standard workday**.

All SURE and Optum-only activities will take place in [Posner Hall](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Posner+Hall,+Pittsburgh,+PA+15213/@40.4410403,-79.9448698,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x8834f220254d5285:0xdadf79d8b1c0495c!8m2!3d40.4410403!4d-79.9422949!16s%2Fm%2F040_67y?entry=ttu) ([__POS 151__](https://www.cmu.edu/computing/services/teach-learn/tes/classrooms/locations/posner.html#151)).
All CMSAC will take place in [Porter Hall](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Porter+Hall/@40.4415995,-79.9488634,17z/data=!3m2!4b1!5s0x8834f220faca6c71:0x6657b762d2a9386a!4m6!3m5!1s0x8834f220dbbb61bd:0x15fc8c298e47685e!8m2!3d40.4415995!4d-79.9462885!16s%2Fg%2F12hrmlsd5?entry=ttu) ([__PH A18A__](https://www.cmu.edu/computing/services/teach-learn/tes/classrooms/locations/porter.html#a18a)) for the duration of the program.
Just two rooms to remember, how easy is that!

In terms of lecture and lab contents, please regularly refer to the
[schedule](schedule.qmd). Please note that the planned schedule is subject to
change at the discretion of the teaching staff.

### Breaks and Holidays

It's important to take good rest during research. Aside from weekend
breaks, we have the following planned breaks and holidays during the
program

-   **Juneteenth:** Monday 06/19.
-   **Independence Day break:** Monday 07/03 to Wed 07/05 (inclusive)
-   **(Optum only) site visit:** Monday 07/17 to Thu 07/20 (inclusive)

## Using Slack effectively

You will receive an invitation to a **Slack workspace** for the summer
program. This will be the main communication channel for students,
faculty, and staff for real time announcements and quick questions. You
should check Slack frequently, especially during working hours. Slack
messages are preferable to emails, but if official channels are required
then email may be more appropriate.

In order to use Slack effectively, please note the following guidelines.
[Akshay](/people/ta/prasadan-akshay.qmd) and
[Yuchen](/people/ta/chen-yuchen.qmd) will be the Slack Champions who will help
manage our Slack workspace according to these guidelines.

-   Ask each other/teaching staff questions first.

    -   We encourage you to reach out to your peers in DMs, group chats,
        in-person, etc. for help before pinging a TA or instructor.

    -   Complicated statistical/programming questions are best asked in
        person during office hours or labs**.**

-   Slack etiquette

    -   To keep the channels organized, please respond using threads, as
        opposed to starting a new thread each message.

    -   Memes and off-topic discussions should be posted outside of the
        main channels, in their own dedicated #random channel.

    -   All Slack communication must abide by the [code of conduct](code-of-conduct.qmd).

-   **Public** channels

    -   [[#announcements]{.underline}](https://cmu-sure-2023.slack.com/archives/C05AE9T570U):
        All major program-wide announcements will be posted here,
        e.g., room changes and lunch logistics.

    -   [[#general]{.underline}](https://cmu-sure-2023.slack.com/archives/C0559U6KDLN):
        Questions/discussion pertaining to the broader program (Optum
        or CMSAC)

    -   [[#random]{.underline}](https://cmu-sure-2023.slack.com/archives/C055DJBKY1K):
        Post your memes, off-topic conversations, outside-events, etc.

-   **Private** channels

    -   [#optum](https://cmu-sure-2023.slack.com/archives/C05AQNMFREV): Private channel for Optum students only and course
        instructors

    -   [#cmsac](https://cmu-sure-2023.slack.com/archives/C05AC1ABY67): Private channel for CMSAC students only and course
        instructors

    -   Project Groups: During the first week, each research group and their TA advisor should
        create a private channel for their day-to-day communication.

  - **Fixed usage hours**

    -   TAs or Instructors will generally be active and responsive on
        Slack during program hours, i.e., **9:30am-4pm weekdays**,
        [not]{.underline} on weekends/holidays, etc.
