Each lecture contains the relevant `pdf` slides, and sometimes additional useful
resources for you to deeply explore a lecture topic. We will continue to update
any additional resources, e.g., youtube links, articles, blog post tutorials
etc., for a given lecture as needed. So please keep checking back in regularly
throughout the program.

### Give us tips!

You are also welcome to suggest new resources (links) for us to include for a 
given topic page. Even referring to your own blog post is fine, as long as it 
is relevant!

You can view all lecture materials by navigating the links in the left sidebar,
or via the [course schedule](../schedule.qmd).
