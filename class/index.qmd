Each lecture in the left sidebar contains the relevant `pdf` slides, and some
additional useful resources for you to deeply explore a lecture topic. We will
continually update any additional resources (e.g., youtube links, articles, blog
post tutorials etc.) for a given lecture as needed. So please keep checking back
in regularly throughout the program.

### Give us tips!

You are also welcome to **suggest new resources (links)** for us to include for
a given topic page. We're always keen to grow the body of knowledge contained in
the lectures throughout the program.

You can view all lecture materials by navigating the links in the left sidebar,
or via the [schedule](../schedule.qmd).
