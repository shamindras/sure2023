# How should we think about spatial data?

Typically location is measured with __latitude__ / __longitude__ (2D)

.pull-left[

- __Latitude__: Measures North / South (the "y-axis")

  - Range is $(-90^{\circ}, 90^{\circ})$
  
  - Measures degrees from the equator $(0^{\circ})$
  
  - $(-90^{\circ}, 0^{\circ})$ = southern hemisphere 
  
  - $(0^{\circ}, 90^{\circ})$ = northern hemisphere 

]


.pull-right[

- __Longitude__: Measures East/West (the "x-axis")

  - Range is $(-180^{\circ}, 180^{\circ})$
  
  - Measures degrees from the prime meridian $(0^{\circ})$ in Greenwich, England
  
  - $(-180^{\circ}, 0^{\circ})$ = eastern hemisphere
  
  - $(0^{\circ}, 180^{\circ})$ = western hemisphere

# Map Projections

- Earth is a 3D object, but maps are 2D objects

- __Map projections__: Transformation of the lat / long coordinates on a sphere (the earth) to a 2D plane
  
- There are many different projections - each will distort the map in different ways.

- The most common projections are:

  - [Mercator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection)
  - [Robinson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_projection)
  - [Conic](http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/gtech201/lectures/lec6concepts/Map%20coordinate%20systems/Conic%20projections.htm#:~:text=Conic%20projections%20are%20created%20by,a%20developable%20map%20projection%20surface.)
  - [Cylindrical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection#Cylindrical)
  - [Planar](http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/gtech201/lectures/lec6concepts/Map%20coordinate%20systems/Planar%20projections.htm)
  - [Interrupted projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interruption_(map_projection))

## Visualizing spatial data on maps using [`ggmap`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggmap/readme/README.html)

.pull-left[

```{r us-map, eval = FALSE}
library(ggmap)
# First, we'll draw a "box" around the US
# (in terms of latitude and longitude)
US <- c(left = -125, bottom = 24, 
        right = -67, top = 49)
map <- get_stamenmap(US, zoom = 5, 
                     maptype = "toner-lite")

# Visualize the basic map
ggmap(map) #<<

```

- Draw map based on lat / lon coordinates

- Put the box into `get_stamenmap()` to access [Stamen Maps](http://maps.stamen.com/#terrain/12/37.7706/-122.3782)

- Draw the map using `ggmap()` to serve as base

(We will only display the continental US for today... sorry Alaska & Hawaii)

```{r ref.label="us-map", echo = FALSE, fig.height=7}

# Three main types of spatial data


1. __Point Pattern Data__: lat-long coordinates where events have occurred

2. __Point-Referenced data__: Latitude-longitude (lat-long) coordinates as well as one or more variables specific to those coordinates.

3. __Areal Data__: Geographic regions with one or more variables associated with those regions.

--

- Each type is structured differently within a dataset

- Each type requires a different kind of graph(s)

--

We'll review each type of data, then demonstrate how to plot these different data types

---

# Point-Pattern data

- __Point Pattern Data__: lat-long coordinates where events have occurred

- __Point pattern data simply records the lat-long of events__; thus, there are only two columns

- Again, latitude and longitude are represented with dots, sometimes called a dot or bubble map.

--

- The goal is to understand how the __density__ of events varies across space

- The density of the dots can also be visualized (e.g., with contours)

  - __Use methods we've discussed before for visualizing 2D joint distribution__


---

# Point-Referenced data

- __Point-Referenced data__: Latitude-longitude (lat-long) coordinates as well as one or more variables specific to those coordinates

- Point-referenced data will have the following form:

```{r eval=FALSE}
data %>% 
  dplyr::select(latitude, longitude,
                <Variables of interest>)
```

--

- The goal is to understand how the variable(s) vary across different spatial locations

- Typically, the latitude and longitude are represented with dots, and the variable(s) are represented with size and/or colors

---

## Data: Hospitals in the US

Information about hospitals including their locations (latitude & longitude), ownership type (non-profit, proprietary, etc.), number of beds, presence of certain treatment units, and more (available via [ArcGIS](https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/geoplatform::hospitals/about))

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
hospitals <- read_csv("https://shorturl.at/hiLR5", na = c("", "NA", "-999"))
hospitals <- hospitals %>% 
  filter(STATUS == "OPEN") %>% 
  select(-c(X, Y, OBJECTID, ID, ZIP4, TELEPHONE, NAICS_CODE, NAICS_DESC, SOURCE,
            SOURCEDATE, VAL_METHOD, VAL_DATE, WEBSITE, ALT_NAME, TTL_STAFF))
head(hospitals, 2)
```

We will be able to use this dataset to show several different kinds of geographical visualizations...

---
## Adding points to the map: `geom_point` layer!

.pull-left[

```{r hospital-points, eval = FALSE}
ggmap(map) +
  geom_point(data = hospitals, #<<
             aes(x = LONGITUDE, y = LATITUDE),
             alpha = 0.25, size = 0.5)
```

- Display locations of hospitals using `geom_point()` layer, need to specify `data` for layer

- Currently viewing __point-pattern__ data 

]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label="hospital-points", echo = FALSE, fig.height=7}

```


]


---


## Display a new variable by altering the points

.pull-left[

```{r hospital-points-plus, eval = FALSE}
ggmap(map) +
  geom_point(data = hospitals, 
             aes(x = LONGITUDE, y = LATITUDE, 
                 size = BEDS, #<<
                 color = BEDS), #<<
             alpha = .5) +
  scale_size_area(breaks = c(1, 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300), 
                  labels = c(1, 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 200, 300), 
                  name = "#Beds") +
  scale_color_distiller(palette = "Spectral") +
  labs(color = "#Beds") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```


- Displaying additional variables through `aes`

- Now seeing __point-referenced__ data: number of beds _referenced_ to the location _point_ of the hospital

]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label="hospital-points-plus", echo = FALSE, fig.height=7}

```

]

---

## This is a bit hard to parse...

.pull-left[

- Too many points overall (N = 7634)
- Too much variability in `BEDS`
```{r}
summary(hospitals$BEDS)
```

Summarize over regions using __areal data__!

]

.pull-right[
```{r ref.label="hospital-points-plus", echo = FALSE, fig.height=7}

```

]

---

## Thinking about areal data

- __Areal Data__: Geographic regions associated with one or more variables specific to those regions

- Areal data will have the following form: 

```{r eval=FALSE}
region_level_data %>% 
  dplyr::select(region_name,
                <Variables of interest>)
```


--

- Need to match the region with the actual geographic boundaries

- Many geographic boundaries/features are stored as "shapefiles"

  - i.e., complicated polygons
  
- Can contain the lines, points, etc. to represent any geographic feature

- Shapefiles are readily available for countries, states, counties, etc.

---

### Typical workflow for plotting areal data (e.g., using states)

1. Get state-specific data

  + e.g., you are working with a dataset that contains information at the state level
  
2. Get state boundaries

  + Access shapefiles using `map_data()` 
  
3. Merge state-specific data with state boundaries (using `left_join()`)

  + Using `left_join()` or `merge` 
  
4. Plot the data!

  + Create choropleths displaying regions colored by variable of interest
  

---

## Wrangle to get data by state

```{r}
library(usdata)

state_hospitals <- hospitals %>% 
  filter(!is.na(BEDS), !STATE %in% c("AS", "GU", "MP", "PW", "PR", "VI")) %>% 
  group_by(STATE) %>% 
  summarise(total_beds = sum(BEDS)) %>% 
  mutate(state = tolower(abbr2state(STATE)))

head(state_hospitals)
```


---

## Access shapefiles using `map_data()` 


```{r}
library(maps)
state_borders <- map_data("state")
head(state_borders)
```

- For example: `map_data("world")`, `map_data("state")`, `map_data("county")` (need to install [`maps` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/maps/maps.pdf))

- Contains lat/lon coordinates to draw geographic boundaries

---

## Merge state-specific data with state boundaries

```{r}
state_plot_data <- state_borders %>%
  left_join(state_hospitals, #<<
            by = c("region" = "state")) #<<
```


--

What it looks like after merging:

```{r}
head(state_plot_data)
```


---
## Create a choropleth map with `geom_polygon()`

.pull-left[

```{r choropleth, eval = FALSE}
state_plot_data %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, 
                   group = group,
                   fill = total_beds), 
               color = "black") + 
  scale_fill_gradient(
    low = "white",
    high = "navy") +
  theme_void() +
  coord_map("polyconic") + 
  labs(fill = "Total Beds") + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```


]
.pull-right[
```{r ref.label="choropleth", echo = FALSE}

```

]

---

## Does _Total Beds_ per state tell the story we want?

--

- California clearly has a lot of hospital beds, but it is also quite populous

--

- Can we find the number of beds __per capita__?

--

First need total population of each state...
There's an `R` package with data for this: `usdata`

```{r}
head(usdata::state_stats)
```

---

### Incorporate this into our state-level hospitals data...

```{r}
state_pop <- tibble(state_stats) %>% 
  select(abbr, pop2010)
state_hospitals <- left_join(state_hospitals, state_pop, 
                             by = c("STATE" = "abbr")) %>% 
  mutate(bed_per_cap = total_beds / pop2010)
head(state_hospitals)
```

```{r}
per_capita_plot_data <- state_borders %>%
  left_join(state_hospitals, by = c("region" = "state"))
```

---

## Plot hospital beds per capita by state

.pull-left[

```{r per-cap, eval = FALSE}
per_capita_plot_data %>%
  ggplot() + 
  geom_polygon(aes(x = long, y = lat, 
                   group = group,
                   fill = bed_per_cap), 
               color = "black") + 
  scale_fill_gradient(
    low = "white",
    high = "navy") +
  theme_void() +
  coord_map("polyconic") + 
  labs(fill = "Beds / Population") + 
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```


What is the difference is the _stories_ told by these plots?

```{r ref.label="per-cap", echo = FALSE}
