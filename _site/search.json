A policy brief is a concise summary of a particular issue, the policy options to deal with it, and some recommendations about the best option. In general, it is written for a non-specialized audience such as policymakers, NGO staff, journalists, and the general public. For this assignment, though, your policy brief readers are policymakers (politicians or civil servants). Assume that your readers do not have detailed knowledge about the topic/issue you explore. They are also not scientists or experts in the area of your choice. Assume that the policymakers are busy and they need to quickly understand your arguments.\nThere are two types of policy brief: (1) advocacy briefs that argue in favor of a particular course of action, and (2) objective briefs that gives balanced information for the policymaker to make up their decision. You will choose either of these types. You will write your brief about one specific topic. Topic examples include (but are not limited to!) questions like:"

The project report thus contains all of the detailed reproducible analysis for your research question. However you are expected (and advised) to work on both the project report and poster concurrently to meet the weekly project milestones.\nAll three project deliverables must only use open data (see data guidelines), and will be publicly linked on our showcase website. The project report analysis must be made available online. It must be fully reproducible and developed only using open source software as taught in the course."

Most importantly, you will practice communicating your work to a broad audience.\n\nProducing high quality project deliverables is an ideal way to broadcast your research for future health and data science related job-search purposes. So please put your best foot forward!"

These should be ideally based on reasoned hypotheses by the team.\nPredictive modeling: Are there demographic and social determinants, access to care factors that are predictors of physical and emotional health. These could be the outcome of carefully applied predictive models."

This dataset also contains the measurements used to calculate the rankings for each county.\nWe recommend reading the background information and video explainers for details.\nIn particular you must (at minimum) utilize the 2023 ranking measures which can provide more insight into the most recent health ranking outcomes priorities. This can be used to better shape your project topic and related hypotheses.\nYour analysis should mainly be done at the entire United States scale (as feasible). However you are welcome to focus on some specific counties/states to test more granular spatial hypotheses.\nAll data used must be publicly available. Any personally identifiable data, or data that is not openly accessible must be removed from your project deliverables before submission.\n\n\n\nOptional: Additional Suggestions and Data Sources\nThe following are some additional guidelines and data sources which you can consider during the course of your project analysis:\n\nThe County Health Rankings Data are typically collected over time.\n\nConsider doing a temporal or trend analysis for your analyses.\nFor predictive modeling consider adding time-varying features or forecasting an outcome, with suitable uncertainty quantification.\n\nConsider whether this County Health Rankings Data can be augmented with other publicly available datasets, over the time periods.\n\nConsider spatiotemporally merging on US Census, or COVID19 data to the County Health Rankings Data.\nSuch data is publicly accessible in R using the {tidycensus} and {covidcast} packages, for example.\nWe note that the County Health Rankings Data is a requirement, but these optional augmented datasets can help you test, and sharpen your hypotheses for some of the collected ranking metrics across US Counties."

Your assigned TA advisor will be your project teams’ primary point of contact throughout the program.\nAll students however are expected to do the majority of the project work together, including collecting datasets, formulating hypotheses, EDA, and predictive modeling etc.\nThe TA advisor will help project guidance and mentorship and mainly help resolve any high level technical issues during your project work.\nAll “project-lab” activities throughout the program will involve meeting with your assigned project team members and typically the TA advisor.\nIt is important for your team members to meet during the assigned times and ensure that you meet the weekly project milestones.\nStudent teams are encouraged to meet during free times during the workday, outside of lectures to continue making progress on the final project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProject Milestones\nThese project milestones are to be met the Friday of each week. During your Friday project lab session, the head instructor (Shamindra Shrotriya) will briefly meet with your project team and your TA advisor. During this meeting, you will provide quick progress update on that weeks’ project milestones, as detailed below:\n\nWeek 1:\n\nMeet your team and TA advisor.\nStart to understand your topic of interest and start noting formulating specific hypotheses.\nYour TA advisor will help you set up a collaboration workflow (e.g., Dropbox, Github).\nSet up the project report document as either a Rmarkdown or a quarto markdown file, and start populating it.\n\nWeek 2:\n\nFormulate initial key hypotheses with TA advisor.\nSource initial datasets and read them into R.\nDo some basic exploratory data analysis (EDA), i.e., produce some summary plots and update your project report. This may change, but keep adding in findings.\nTA Advisor to set up an overleaf project poster file for the team. Must be A2 landscape format. Your team can use other formats per your preference.\nStart also populating some poster sections like the introduction, data sources, and placeholder for the conclusion. Mirror these from your project report.\nYour project report and poster should be done concurrently to save time!\n\nWeek 3:\n\nMore hypotheses should be tested and introduction, data sources section should be finalized in both the project report and project poster.\nAdditional exploratory plot with commentary should be finalized in both the project report and project poster.\nCarefully list assumptions, not just insights when summarizing any findings.\nStart preparing predictive modeling questions of interest and source some datasets in R to help answer the questions.\n\nWeek 4:\n\nAdditional exploratory plots with commentary should be finalized in both the project report and project poster.\nPredictive models should be run. Check which predictors provide most explanatory power for the outcome. Note down key assumptions and data limitations as you draft your report and poster findings.\n\nWeek 5:\n\nRefine your predictive models. Draft predictive questions section in the poster, including question, data, and methodology used. Explain your model and variable selection procedures used.\nReport should be drafted at this stage, similar to the poster.\n\nWeek 6:\n\nPolish the report and poster. Ensure that you can generate pdf and html files for the report submission.\nCreate a basic slide deck and summarize main results. This should be a quarto markdown reveal.js document, as taught in the course lectures.\nYou will have only 5 minutes for your presentation, so it should be a maximum of 5 slides.\n\nWeek 7:\n\nOptum HQ visit 07/17 to 07/20 (inclusive).\nNot much work to do this week.\nJust keep polishing the report and poster session in the background on the Friday project-lab.\n\nWeek 8:\n\nSubmit your project poster pdf by 07/27 to allow for printing.\nSubmit your project report pdf and html files by 07/27.\nSubmit your project slide deck pdf by 07/27."
