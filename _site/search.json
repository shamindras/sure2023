The project report thus contains all of the detailed reproducible analysis for your research question. However you are expected (and advised) to work on both the project report and poster concurrently to meet the weekly project milestones.\nAll three project deliverables must only use open data (see data guidelines), and will be publicly linked on our showcase website. The project report analysis must be made available online. It must be fully reproducible and developed only using open source software as taught in the course."

This dataset also contains the measurements used to calculate the rankings for each county.\nWe recommend reading the background information and video explainers for details.\nIn particular you must (at minimum) utilize the 2023 ranking measures which can provide more insight into the most recent health ranking outcomes priorities. This can be used to better shape your project topic and related hypotheses.\nYour analysis should mainly be done at the entire United States scale (as feasible). However you are welcome to focus on some specific counties/states to test more granular spatial hypotheses.\nAll data used must be publicly available. Any personally identifiable data, or data that is not openly accessible must be removed from your project deliverables before submission.\n\n\n\nOptional: Additional Suggestions and Data Sources\nThe following are some additional guidelines and data sources which you can consider during the course of your project analysis:\n\nThe County Health Rankings Data are typically collected over time.\n\nConsider doing a temporal or trend analysis for your analyses.\nFor predictive modeling consider adding time-varying features or forecasting an outcome, with suitable uncertainty quantification.\n\nConsider whether this County Health Rankings Data can be augmented with other publicly available datasets, over the time periods.\n\nConsider spatiotemporally merging on US Census, or COVID19 data to the County Health Rankings Data.\nSuch data is publicly accessible in R using the {tidycensus} and {covidcast} packages, for example.\nWe note that the County Health Rankings Data is a requirement, but these optional augmented datasets can help you test, and sharpen your hypotheses for some of the collected ranking metrics across US Counties."

During your Friday project lab session, the head instructor (Shamindra Shrotriya) will briefly meet with your project team and your TA advisor. During this meeting, you will provide quick progress update on that weeks’ project milestones, as detailed below:\n\nWeek 1:\n\nMeet your team and TA advisor.\nStart to understand your topic of interest and start noting formulating specific hypotheses.\nYour TA advisor will help you set up a collaboration workflow (e.g., Dropbox, Github).\nSet up the project report document as either a Rmarkdown or a quarto markdown file, and start populating it.\n\nWeek 2:\n\nFormulate initial key hypotheses with TA advisor.\nSource initial datasets and read them into R.\nDo some basic exploratory data analysis (EDA), i.e., produce some summary plots and update your project report. This may change, but keep adding in findings.\nTA Advisor to set up an overleaf project poster file for the team. Must be A2 landscape format. Your team can use other formats per your preference.\nStart also populating some poster sections like the introduction, data sources, and placeholder for the conclusion. Mirror these from your project report.\nYour project report and poster should be done concurrently to save time!\n\nWeek 3:\n\nMore hypotheses should be tested and introduction, data sources section should be finalized in both the project report and project poster.\nAdditional exploratory plot with commentary should be finalized in both the project report and project poster.\nCarefully list assumptions, not just insights when summarizing any findings.\nStart preparing predictive modeling questions of interest and source some datasets in R to help answer the questions.\n\nWeek 4:\n\nAdditional exploratory plots with commentary should be finalized in both the project report and project poster.\nPredictive models should be run. Check which predictors provide most explanatory power for the outcome. Note down key assumptions and data limitations as you draft your report and poster findings.\n\nWeek 5:\n\nRefine your predictive models. Draft predictive questions section in the poster, including question, data, and methodology used. Explain your model and variable selection procedures used.\nReport should be drafted at this stage, similar to the poster.\n\nWeek 6:\n\nPolish the report and poster. Ensure that you can generate pdf and html files for the report submission.\nCreate a basic slide deck and summarize main results. This should be a quarto markdown reveal.js document, as taught in the course lectures.\nYou will have only 5 minutes for your presentation, so it should be a maximum of 5 slides.\n\nWeek 7:\n\nOptum HQ visit 07/17 to 07/20 (inclusive).\nNot much work to do this week.\nJust keep polishing the report and poster session in the background on the Friday project-lab.\n\nWeek 8:\n\nSubmit your project poster pdf by 07/27 to allow for printing.\nSubmit your project report pdf and html files by 07/27.\nSubmit your project slide deck pdf by 07/27."

This is a free, browser-based version of R and RStudio that also provides access to a growing number of R tutorials / primersrelevant to the summer program material\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetup Posit Cloud\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter you create a free Posit Cloud account, click on the navigation menu by “Your Workspace”. Then click on “Primers” to bring up a menu of tutorials. Prior to June 6th, please complete the following (listed in order of importance):\n\nin “The Basics”, you only need to complete the “Programming Basics” primer,\ncomplete all three primers in “Work with Data”,\ncomplete all seven primers in “Write Functions”.\n\nFeel free to explore the other primers listed, specifically for “Iterate” and “Tidy Your Data”. We will be covering data visualization extensively in the first two weeks, so you do not worry about working through the data visualization primers.\nAfter completing the above primers available on the RStudio Cloud, try replicating the some type of R programming basics in your own local version of R and RStudio installed on your computer. RStudio Cloud is a great practical alternative to use in case we are unable to resolve errors with regards to installation on your own personal computer (an unlikely scenario). We strongly encourage you to use an installed version of R and RStudio throughout the program, due to RStudio Cloud data limitations that are important for your research projects throughout the summer.\n\n\n\nDo not worry if you are unable to complete all of the R tutorials and steps above prior to June 5th. The teaching assistants will be reviewing the R and tidyverse basics and materials in the first week’s lab sessions. Again, if you have any questions, do not hesitate to reach out to the instructors above and we look forward to meeting you June 5th!"

    "text": "A friendly note from your friendly co-instructor Meg\n\n\n\nPittsburgh gets a bad rap, but I’ve found it to be a really fun, active, vibrant city! To that end, as an instructor I want you to get the most out of this program, both academically and personally, so I’ve compiled a list of fun activities that you could try if you find yourself bored in the evenings or on the weekends. Note that it may be a bit biased. I haven’t tried/visited each of these things, but the ones I haven’t done myself still come highly recommended from friends in town. I hope you can get out there and do some cool stuff!\n–Meg\n\n\n\nIf you’re into sports\nPittsburgh sports are awesome (regardless of how well the teams may or may not be doing in their respective seasons…). It’s a big deal here. Also, fun fact, the city requires all professional teams to have Black & Gold as their colors.\n\nPittsburgh Pirates (MLB)\n\nArguably one of the most beautiful stadium views in baseball (looks out over downtown PGH)\nTickets usually quite accessible, compared to other MLB teams, can be found here\n\nPittsburgh Riverhounds SC (USL Championship)\n\nFirst-tier experience for second-tier prices, find tickets here\n\nPittsburgh Steelers (NFL, out of season)\nPittsburgh Penguins (NHL, out of season)\n\n\n\nIf you love nature\n\nPhipps Conservatory\n\nBeautiful botanical gardens just a stone’s throw away from campus\nLots of cool events, see the website for details\n\nFrick Park\n\nFantastic walking/running trails, great hammock spots\nHonestly feels like you’ve escaped to the wilderness but you’re still in Pittsburgh\n\nSchenley Park\n\nEven closer to campus than Frick, somewhat smaller but equally beautiful\nThe sunset over Flagstaff Hill is just *chef’s kiss*\n\nThree Rivers Heritage Trail\n\nPaved trail for walking/running/biking\nCan be accessed from various points around the city, I usually go to the Southside Riverfront Park for long runs\n\n\n\n\nIf you like culture\n\nCarnegie Library\n\nA whole network of libraries across the city, but it’s main location is at the Museum on Forbes (see below)\nLots of events available, and just a cool spot\n\nCarnegie Museum\n\nActually four museums, including the Museum of Art, Museum of Natural History, Science Center, and the Andy Warhol Museum\nI can personally vouch for the Science Center being really fun, but I’ve heard the others are quite cool as well, and a few of them are walking distance from campus\n\nVarious festivals\n\nYou can find a list of annual events here– Picklesburgh is a personal favorite!\nThere are also plenty of nice farmers markets to check out\n\n\n\n\nGenerally cool areas to explore\n\nStrip District\n\nSpecialty grocery stores (Korean, Mexican, Italian, etc.)\nRestaurants, coffee shops, various other food-related activities\n\nDowntown (Dahntahn)\n\nPoint State Park sits at the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela\nThe Duquesne Incline is a classic Pittsburgh tourist activity\n\nLawrenceville (Butler St.), Shadyside (Walnut St.), Squirrel Hill (Murray Ave)\n\nNeighborhoods with some nice shopping/restaurant areas\n\nSome restaurants that I recommend (again, biased, not exhaustive)\n\nKiin Lao (prev. Bangkok Balcony, Squirrel Hill)\nUdipi (Monroeville, very far but so delicious, no online presence whatsoever)\nStack’d (Oakland, custom burgers, very close to campus)\nIron Born Pizza (Detroit-style, which I did not know existed, good delivery option)"

These are a fantastic networking opportunity for Optum students for future career opportunities. For the sports side, the first few weeks will involve sports analysts coming in to pitch projects in baseball, hockey, basketball, and soccer. You’ll have the chance to then choose one of these projects to work on for the rest of the summer. There will also be various visitors later on to speak about working in sports analytics."

In dedicated project-lab sessions, you’ll work in a group of 2-4 students to analyze a dataset in health or sports analytics to answer a research question that is important to practitioners in your field. Past projects have examined geographic differences in the impact of the opioid epidemic, built models to predict passing or running plays in the NFL, and performed cluster analysis of NBA and WNBA players. At the end of the program, you’ll hand in a report summarizing your findings, create a poster, and deliver a short presentation to the community and project stakeholders."

As stated before, there is no textbook for this program, just lecture slides that you’ll be able to access via the schedule. There you will also find specifications for the projects and lab files.\nFor non-academic concerns, we have compiled a list of helpful guides, e.g., computing setup, Pittsburgh-based resources, fun local activities. We also have dedicated staff bios to help you quickly find the right person for any questions that might arise. Keep browsing around, we’ll keep adding to it over the program to make it your ‘one-stop-shop’ for all your major concerns."

It will be the most up-to-date source of information about when and where things will be happening in the program.\nA glimpse of a ‘typical’ week, via the Google Calendar, is as follows:\n\n\n\nAs mentioned, data-science lectures for all SURE 2023 students will take place in the morning. Then there will be separate presentations for the Optum and CMSAC groups around lunchtime, and in the afternoon we will have demo-labs, data-engineering, and project labs. As mentioned, you are expected to attend program activities in-person during the standard workday.\nAll SURE and Optum-only activities will take place in Posner Hall (POS 151). All CMSAC will take place in Porter Hall (PH A18A) for the duration of the program. Just two rooms to remember, how easy is that!\nIn terms of lecture and lab contents, please regularly refer to the schedule. Please note that the planned schedule is subject to change at the discretion of the teaching staff.\n\nBreaks and Holidays\nIt’s important to take good rest during research. Aside from weekend breaks, we have the following planned breaks and holidays during the program\n\nJuneteenth: Monday 06/19.\nIndependence Day break: Monday 07/03 to Wed 07/05 (inclusive)\n(Optum only) site visit: Monday 07/17 to Thu 07/20 (inclusive)"
